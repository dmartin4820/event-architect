## Example case:
### Surprise ðŸŽ‚ Birthday Party at The Colliseum
<details><summary><strong>Freddie's first birthday is coming up!!!</strong></summary>
He's <em>never had</em> a birthday. So, a big surpirise party it is! He loves rock music, and I want to surprise him by having ten of our closest friends and family meet us in our seats.

<strong>Now to organize this <em>private party</em> at a <em>public event!</em></strong>

#### <strong>Event Architect</strong> to the rescue!
First, I point my browser to the [Event Architect](https://dmartin4820.github.io/event-architect/) website and make a login:
![Login gif](./assets/gifs/e-a_make-a-login.gif)

Now I need to find a local rock show for the weekend of my dog's birthday.  A quick query of the TicketMaster API reveals that Queen with Adam Lambert is playing at the Colliseum!  His favorite band ever!!  Then we're going to the beach . . .
![Search Public Events gif](./assets/images/e-a_ticketmaster.png)

I create the event:
![Ticketmaster image](./assets/gifs/e-a_create-event.gif)

From my Member Dashboard, I can add the first detail cards to the event:
* Shhhhh Surprise Party!!
* date and time
* venue, tickets in will Call
* Park in and enter from the North Lot (we'll park and enter from the South Lot)
* Shhhhh <strong>SURPRISE</strong> Party!!!!
* Suntan Lotion!
![Add Details gif](./assets/gifs/e-a_add-details.gif)

Make a (List.js)[https://listjs.com/] and (Browserify)[https://browserify.org/] assisted earch for friends, then let's follow our friends so they can view and contribute to our surprise party planning:
![Follow Friends gif](./assets/gifs/e-a_search-friend.gif)

We will soon be able to privately chat live with other members through Socket.io!

<strong>Surprise</strong> - no one leaked our secret plans!!! Let's look at the parties we have coming up:
