## Example case:
### Surprise ðŸŽ‚ Birthday Party at The Colliseum
<details><summary><strong>Emma's birthday is coming up!!!</strong></summary>
She <em>hates</em> birthdays AND surprises. So, a big surpirise party it is! She loves big rock shows, and I want to surprise her by having ten of our closest friends and family meet us in our seats at a local show.

<strong>Now to organize this <em>private party</em> at a <em>public event!</em></strong>

#### <strong>Event Architect</strong> to the rescue!
I point my browser to the [Event Architect](https://dmartin4820.github.io/event-architect/) website and make a login:

Now I need to find a local rock show for the weekend of my wife's birthday.  A quick query of the TicketMaster API reveals that Queen with Adam Lambert is playing at the Colliseum!  Her favorite band ever!!
